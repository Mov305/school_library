# School_library

- For this project we learned how to use a module inside a class in Ruby. We created classes and methods to manage a school library.
  We created a class `Person` with the following:
  - Instance vars: `@id`, `@name`, and `@age`.
  - Getters for `@id`, `@name`, and `@age`.
  - Setters for `@name` and `@age`.
  - `private` `is_of_age?` that returns `true` if `@age` is greater or equal to 18 and `false` otherwise.
  - `public` method `can_use_services?` that returns `true` if person is of age or if they have permission from a parent.
    we created a class `Student` with the following:
  - Inherits from `Person`.
  - Constructor extends parent's constructar by adding `@classroom` and a parameter for it.
  - Method `play_hooky` that returns `"¯\(ツ)/¯"`.
    we created a class `Teacher` with the following:
  - Inherits from `Person`.
  - Constructor extends parent's constructar by adding `@specialization` and a parameter for it.
  - Override `can_use_services?` so it always returns `true`.
